#Notes

Everything is handled through vundle, so just vimrc here.


#Installation

clone the repo to ~/.vim

ln -s ~./vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc

vim

:BundleInstall

Restart vim... and presto!

#Pro tip
* snipMate keymapping need to be changed in ~/.vim/bundle/snipmate.vim/after/plugin/snipMate.vim if it bothers you that it interferes with the FoolishTab() backup
